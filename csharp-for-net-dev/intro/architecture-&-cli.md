2. **Language Compilers**:
   - .NET Core supports multiple programming languages, including C#, F#, and Visual Basic, through the Roslyn compiler.
   - C# programs or .NET Core applications are compiled into Intermediate Language (IL) code, which is then executed by the .NET runtime environment provided by the Core CLR.
   - The **Roslyn** compiler is specifically used for C# and Visual Basic, while F# has its own compiler called **FSC**.

3. **Core CLR**:
   - Core CLR is the runtime used in .NET Core applications, responsible for compiling and executing these applications.
   - It converts code into a low-level or intermediate language before compiling it into the final executable format.
   - Core CLR provides several important features:
     - **Garbage Collection**: Automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation.
     - **Just-In-Time Compilation**: Compiles code at runtime to improve performance.
     - **Memory Management**: Efficiently handles memory use.
     - **Exception Handling**: Manages runtime errors.
     - **Authentication and Authorization**: Ensures secure access to applications.

4. **Advantages of Core CLR**:
   - It is lightweight and modular compared to the full .NET Framework, making applications robust, scalable, and fast.
   - Optimized for modern hardware and execution environments.
   - Consumes fewer resources than the traditional .NET Framework.

5. **CoreFX Libraries**:
   - CoreFX provides a wide range of libraries for .NET Core applications, supporting various functionalities like file I/O, networking, collections, and generics.
   - The modular nature of CoreFX allows developers to select only the libraries they need for their applications.

6. **Summary**:
   - The .NET Core architecture is explained as a robust, flexible, and optimized framework for modern application development, providing support for multiple programming languages and a modular approach to using libraries.

The session concludes with a brief goodbye, encouraging viewers to stay tuned for future discussions.

## Demo: Building a basic .NET Core console application

Here are the key notes from the text:

1. **Objective**: The session focuses on building a basic .NET Core console application using .NET CLI commands.

2. **Steps to Create a Console Application**:
   - Navigate to the desired repository where you want to generate the project.
   - Use the command `.net new list` to check available commands and options for creating a console application.
   - Use the short name `console` to create a console application with the command `.net new console`.
   - Specify the application name using `-n <name>` or `--name=<name>`.

3. **Project Location**:
   - The project will be generated in the current repository unless specified otherwise using the `-o` option to set an output folder.

4. **Building and Running the Application**:
   - Navigate into the project folder.
